Location:

Patient Instructions:

Nursing Instructions:

Scrub Notes:
 No need for monopolar diathermy, even for fat graft, as only bipolar is used. There is an 11 blade in the pack – use this on the vertical bayonette blade holder. Do not use the 90° Kerrisons punch – use the 45°. Dural sealant to be used for gluing fat graft in nasal cavity.
Pre-procedure Prep Instructions:
 Abdomen is always prepped with chloraprep. Aqueous Chlorhexidine (unisept) 0.05% w/v is used for the nose. Clamp each blob in an artery clip and leave on the prep trolley for Ms Grieve to dip into the prep. Have small iobane cut into two for fat graft and nose. Small drapes for abdomen, large drapes down patient's sides wrapping around the head, Ioban on abdomen and nose, split sheet. May need extra small drape for patient's head.

Positioning Instructions:
 Supine with head ring (or Supine with Mayfield pins if using stealth). Ms Grieve is north of the patient, looking down the length of the patient. The Scrub nurse is on Ms Grieve’s right, with the rectangular scrub trolley positioned lengthways 

Other Info:
 • May require part of specimen to go to research, otherwise all of it goes to histology. The specimen for research needs to be placed and kept in the specimen pot that is provided by the research team (pink solution). Research specimen requires blood sample.
• Patient may require a Lumber Drain.
• The air pump is required for applying the duraseal when performing a fat graft. When using the air pump, do not switch on or off until Ms Grieve say so, as there may be a need to re-use the remaining duraseal, and the pump prevents the sealant in the nozzle drying out.

Instructions:
Scheduling Instructions:

Nursing Instructions:

Scrub Notes:
 Clipping is performed in three stages: temporary clip applied, permanent clip applied, and temporary clip removed. Ensure the clip is loaded onto the clip applicator properly to prevent the clip being unable to be detached from it.Count all clips and check number as part of the scrub counts by keeping the wrapping they were supplied in.
Pre-procedure Prep Instructions:
 Chloraprep large (x2) and then, four small drapes around the head, Ioban and then the split sheet
Positioning Instructions:
 As per team brief
Other Info:
 Ensure arrest trolley is accessible as the anaesthetist will use Adenosine to take the blood pressure down as much as possible to prevent aneurysm bursting
Have two suction units set up
When clipping, there is a need to time the moment the temporary clip is applied and when it is removed to ensure it does not cause long term brain injury.
Doppler is used to check for blood flow.
The IR-800 infrared view from the microscope is also used to check for blood flow (or lack of it within the aneurysm) when ICG is given by the anaesthetist. Before the operation, the IR-800 microscope must be set up and tested to ensure it will operate for infrared viewing as follows. 
PCom – posterior communicating aneurysm
ACom – anterior communicating aneurysm
If using SUGITTA clips, make sure the clips are organised correctly in the right tray of the set, as they can become jumbled between trays in transit.
